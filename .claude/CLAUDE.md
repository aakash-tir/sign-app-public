# Sign App — Project Guide

A cross-platform **PWA that teaches American Sign Language (ASL)** by having the
learner perform signs in front of their camera and getting automatic, on-device
feedback. Runs on Windows, Android, iOS, and Linux from one React + TypeScript
codebase; a Python pipeline (build-time only) trains the recognition model.

## Documentation map

| Doc | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [`project-context.md`](project-context.md) | **Product spec** — modes, levels, bucket rules, UX. The "what". |
| [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) | **Architecture** — tech stack, repo layout, data model, data flow, hosting. |
| [`docs/recognition.md`](docs/recognition.md) | **ASL recognition & ML pipeline** — MediaPipe + classifier, datasets, risks, research sources. |
| [`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md) | **Phase 1 milestone plan** — M0–M7 (complete), branches, acceptance criteria, tests. |
| [`docs/phase2.md`](docs/phase2.md) | **Phase 2 plan** — depth & polish milestones (P2M1–P2M5) after M0–M7. |
| [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md) | **Decision log (ADRs)** + open questions. |
| [`docs/hosting.md`](docs/hosting.md) | **Hosting** — what Cloudflare Pages is and how we deploy. |
| [`progress.md`](progress.md) | **Live status** — which milestone we're on, what's done. |
| [`rules/`](rules/) | **Coding standards** — frontend, Python, and git/CI workflow. |
| [`../plan.md`](../plan.md) | The owner's plan. **Now holds the Phase 2 plan**; per-item analysis is in [`../output.md`](../output.md). (M0–M7 intent lives in these `.claude` docs.) |

## The 60-second summary

- **Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + `vite-plugin-pwa` (runtime).
  **Python** (`uv`, MediaPipe, TF/Keras) for training only — see ADR-004.
- **Recognition:** MediaPipe Tasks Vision extracts hand/pose landmarks **on-device**,
  a small **TF.js** classifier labels the sign. No video leaves the device; works
  offline (ADR-002).
- **Scope:** MVP = fingerspelling + curated common signs; broad word-level
  recognition is research-hard and phased/accuracy-gated (ADR-007).
- **Persistence:** local-first, IndexedDB via Dexie (ADR-005).

## Working agreement (from the plan — non-negotiable)

1. Work in **milestones**; each milestone is a **branch → PR → squash-merge** into
   `main`.
2. A milestone merges **only when all tests pass and all quality gates are green**:
   - Python (`ml/`): `ruff format` + `ruff check` + `mypy .` + `pytest`.
   - Frontend (`frontend/`): Prettier + ESLint + `tsc --noEmit` + Vitest + Playwright.
3. Every milestone ships **tests proving its features work**.
4. Keep `.claude/` docs current — especially [`progress.md`](progress.md).
5. The repo is **private**.
6. **Stop and ask the owner** for any secret/credential/account-only item (API
   keys, hosting logins, paid sign-ups, dataset auth) — never invent or assume
   them. Explain how to obtain it if the owner doesn't know.

See [`rules/workflow.md`](rules/workflow.md) for the exact branch/PR/gate steps
and the secrets/credentials policy.

## Status

**Phase 1 (M0–M7) is complete and deployed** — the PWA is live on Cloudflare
(see [`progress.md`](progress.md)). Now in **Phase 2 (depth & polish)**: scoping
**P2M1** (per-finger overlay colors). The Phase 2 plan is in
[`docs/phase2.md`](docs/phase2.md).
